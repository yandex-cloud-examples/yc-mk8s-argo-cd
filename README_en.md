# Continuous delivery of applications to a Yandex Managed Service for Kubernetes® cluster using Argo CD

You can integrate [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable) with [Managed Service for Kubernetes®](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-kubernetes) and [Managed Service for GitLab](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-gitlab), and then use Argo CD to deploy applications. See [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-kubernetes/tutorials/marketplace/argo-cd) to learn how to prepare the infrastructure for Managed Service for Kubernetes® and Container Registry using Terraform.
